# EVENT HORIZON - COMPREHENSIVE VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

## ✅ ROUTING & URL STRUCTURE

### .htaccess Configuration
- ✅ Rewrites all URLs to Index.php?url=$1
- ✅ Base path set to /~ks9700/iste-341/Event_Horizon_Milestone4/

- ✅ Matches: event/edit/5
- ✅ Defaults to UserController::login if no match
- ✅ Passes params array to controller methods

## ✅ CONTROLLERS

### UserController

- ✅ logout() - destroys session
- ✅ welcome() - protected page
- ✅ admin() - admin-only page
- ✅ Redirects admin to /event/index
- ✅ Redirects attendee to /attendee/dashboard

### EventController

- ✅ create() - admin only, shows form
- ✅ store() - admin only, creates event
- ✅ edit($params) - admin only, shows edit form
- ✅ update() - admin only, updates event
- ✅ destroy() - admin only, deletes event

### AttendeeController
- ✅ session_start() in constructor
- ✅ dashboard() - simple attendee portal

### VenueController
- ✅ session_start() in constructor
- ✅ index() - lists all venues

## ✅ MODELS

### Database.php
- ✅ Reads config from CONFIG_PATH/config.ini
- ✅ PDO connection with error mode
- ✅ Singleton pattern

### UserModel
- ✅ authenticate() - returns user array with role_name
- ✅ register() - creates new user
- ✅ getRoles() - for registration form

- ✅ name = ks9700

- ✅ pass = Mugil2-converter

## ✅ AUTHENTICATION & SESSION

### Session Flow
1. ✅ UserController::login() creates $_SESSION['user'] with full array
2. ✅ $_SESSION['user'] includes: id, username, email, role_name
3. ✅ All protected pages check isset($_SESSION['user'])
4. ✅ Admin pages check role_name === 'admin'
5. ✅ session_start() called in every controller constructor

## ✅ ADMIN vs ATTENDEE EXPERIENCE

- ✅ Stats cards (events, registrations, venues, sold out)
- ✅ Quick action buttons (create, venues, print, logout)
- ✅ Full event management table
- ✅ View/Edit/Delete actions for each event
- ✅ Registration status with progress bars

### Attendee Dashboard (/attendee/dashboard)
- ✅ Simple welcome card
- ✅ Two action cards: Browse Events, Sign Out
- ✅ No management features
- ✅ Clean, minimal design

## 🔍 POTENTIAL ISSUES TO VERIFY

1. ⚠️ Router params splitting
   - URL: /event/attendees/5
   - params string: "/5"
   - After split: ["", "5"]
   - Controller receives: $params[0] = "" (empty), $params[1] = "5"
   - **FIX NEEDED**: Should filter empty values after split

2. ⚠️ View file for admin.php might not be used
   - admin.php exists but might be old
   - events.php is the actual admin dashboard
   - Should verify if admin.php is needed

## 🎯 TEST SCENARIOS

### Test 1: Login as Admin
1. Go to /user/login
2. Enter admin credentials
3. Should redirect to /event/index
4. Should see Admin Control Center dashboard

### Test 2: View Event Attendees
1. Login as admin
2. Click eye icon on any event
3. URL should be /event/attendees/{id}
4. Should show attendee list

### Test 3: Edit Event
1. Login as admin
2. Click edit icon on any event
3. URL should be /event/edit/{id}
4. Should show pre-filled form
5. Submit should update event

### Test 4: Create Event
1. Login as admin
2. Click "Create New Event" button
3. URL should be /event/create
4. Fill form and submit
5. Should redirect to /event/index with new event

### Test 5: Login as Attendee
1. Go to /user/login
2. Enter attendee credentials
3. Should redirect to /attendee/dashboard
4. Should see simple portal (NOT admin dashboard)

## 🐛 KNOWN ISSUES & FIXES

### Issue 1: Router param indexing
**Problem**: When URL is /event/attendees/5, after explode("/", "/5"), we get ["", "5"]
**Fix**: Filter empty values from params array in Router

### Issue 2: Duplicate session_start()
**Status**: NOT AN ISSUE - PHP handles multiple calls gracefully

### Issue 3: View naming mismatch
**Status**: FIXED - Controllers now manually load correct view files

## ✅ FINAL VERIFICATION STEPS

1. Clear browser cache and cookies
2. Test all URLs manually:
   - /user/login ✅
   - /user/register ✅
   - /attendee/dashboard ✅
   - /event/index ✅
   - /event/attendees/1 ⚠️ (verify param handling)
   - /event/edit/1 ⚠️ (verify param handling)
   - /event/create ✅
   - /venue/index ✅
   - /user/logout ✅

3. Test authentication flow:
   - Login as admin → should see admin dashboard ✅
   - Login as attendee → should see attendee portal ✅
   - Access protected page without login → redirect to login ✅

4. Test CRUD operations:
   - Create event ⚠️
   - Edit event ⚠️
   - Delete event ⚠️
   - View attendees ⚠️

## 🔧 CRITICAL FIX NEEDED

The Router needs to filter empty strings from params array!
